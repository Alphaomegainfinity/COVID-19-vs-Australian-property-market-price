###                                                     Review Summary 

#### 1. What was the effect of Covid19 on the Australian house prices?

        In the review of our data we found that COVID-19 is tied to a sharp increase in house prices across 
        Australia.
        Rate of house price increase was almost identical between regional and urban from 2020 onwards.
        Difference of less than 2%, with a 99% confidence interval.
        This means the percentage increase in house prices was significantly higher for rural areas.

#### 2. Did the number of house sales increase due to Covid19?

        For this question we found that Large amount of fluctuation in house sales and that house 
        sales were typically trending downwards in 2019
        After the impact of COVID-19 there was large spike in rural and city house sales but quantity wise 
        rural areas had higher sales.

#### 3. What regional areas showed the biggest increase in % sales price during Covid19?
    
        The data showed that New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania showed the biggest percentage increases with 
        Tasmania also putting in a strong increase.
        This shows that after the onset of Covid19 there was a sharp percentage increase in key regional areas but did not rise as sharply across the rest of the country’s regional areas except for Tasmania. 

#### 4. What city areas showed the biggest increase in % sales price during Covid19?

        The data shows that Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart showed a significant percentage increase from 2018 
        to 2021. 
        This shows that after the onset of Covid19 there was a sharp increase in key metro areas but not as sharp 
        across the rest of the country's metro areas. 

#### 5. What state/states showed the biggest average increase in sales price over the year?

        We found that there was a clear difference in house price increase between states
        NSW:  highest house prices (>$1M)
        VIC: ~ $800k
        QLD ~$600k
        where as the rest saw small increased in line with normal market growth

#### 6. What was the average sales price before and after Covid19 per state?

        We found that the average sales price jumped dramatically in the largest real estate markets 
        (NSW, VIC and QLD)
        and we also saw a large increase in the Tasmanian market, other states saw increases but not as dramatic as 
        the major markets.
