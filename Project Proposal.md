                                              Project Description 


The basis of our project is to analyise the impact of Covid19 on housing sale values around Australia. In our analysis we look at the cost of dwellings in major cities and rural areas before the beginning of Covid19 and how the impact of Covid19 effected housing prices in cities vs regional areas.

                                          Research questions to answer
                                          
1. What was the effect of Covid19 on the Australian house prices?

2. Did the number of house sales increase due to Covid19?

3. What regional areas showed the biggest increase in % sales price during Covid19?

4. What city areas showed the biggest increase in % sales price during Covid19?

5. What state/states showed the biggest average increase in sales price over the year?

6. What was the average sales price before and after Covid19 per state?
